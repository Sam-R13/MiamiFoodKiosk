# MiamiFoodKiosk

This project was born out of a recent change here on Miami's campus. 
In the Armstrong Student Center, several of the food stations stopped using human cashiers, and implemented touchscreen kiosks for students to use. 
These kiosks are incredibly flawed. 
There are several basic edge test cases that totally break the functionality of the program. 
There is no way to remove items or customizations from orders. 
If you accidentally add an item or topping that you didn't want to order, you must cancel your check and start all over again. 
It also doesn't prevent you from adding duplicate toppings, meaning you may accidentally add (and get charged for) four onion toppings on one burger, for example.
This was bothering me for a while, and finally I decided to create a program that would perform these functions properly.
This is version 1.0, performed with no knowledge whatsoever of the source code for the kiosks, and with no prior experience in building PoS systems.
I decided to write this entirely in C++, even though most of my previous experience in programming is in Java.
